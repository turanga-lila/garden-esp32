# Troubleshooting Guide

## BLE (ESP32 + Flutter)
- **Device shows with no name**:
  - Ensure `pAdvertising->setName("GardenMonitor");`.
- **Not visible in scanner**:
  - Check USB power stability.
  - Avoid duplicate `startAdvertising()` calls.
- **Flutter shows "Bluetooth permissions required"**:
  - Android 12+: need `BLUETOOTH_SCAN` + `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` + `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`.
  - Request runtime permissions with `permission_handler`.

## Flutter Build Issues
- **"Build failed due to use of deleted Android v1 embedding"**:
  - Ensure `MainActivity.kt` extends `FlutterActivity`.
  - Delete legacy `MainActivity.java` if present.
- **Gradle mismatch**:
  - `distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-8.0.2-all.zip`
  - Kotlin: 1.9.x (stable with Flutter 3.x).

## Git
- **Wrong remote merge**:
  - Fix with `git remote set-url origin ...`.
  - If needed: `git revert -m 1 <merge_commit>`.
- **Lost uncommitted changes after reset**:
  - Check `.git/lost-found` or editor local history.

## NFC
- **Tag not writable**:
  - Ensure NTAG215 supports NDEF, and itâ€™s not locked.
- **iOS reads but Android fails**:
  - Confirm tag type (avoid MIFARE Classic).
- **No app launch after scan**:
  - Use standard NDEF URL record (both platforms parse it).

## General
- Always make a **WIP commit** before risky Git ops.
- Test on both Android + iOS early (permission + NFC differences).
- Prefer `Timer.periodic()` for periodic reads, not while-loops.
